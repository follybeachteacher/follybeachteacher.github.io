##What do you think being a data scientist is about?

After reading several articles about data science, I’ve come to believe that a data scientist is a statistician, a code writer, and a problem solver. The job seems to entail so many more things than being a statistician. As a statistician in my own was as a teacher, I collect and analyze data. I provide trends and analysis with ideas for what future research might involve. A data scientist may be an engineer or a data miner or someone who is teching machines how to think.

Yes, statisicians make predictions and offer direction to others. With the rise of technology and machine learning, statistics alone just doesn’t seem to be enough anymore. That very thought is what lead me to do some work in Applied Statistics. It has pushed me out of my comfort zone and given me some insights I didn’t have before. Maybe one day when I grow up, I might too become a data scientist. Until then, I will keep sharing my love of statistics with those and with those in my life.
